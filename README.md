# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Password Strength Analyzer** is a **GUI-based Python application** that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords. It provides **real-time feedback** on password security, generates **SHA-256 hashes**, and includes additional features like **clipboard copying** and **dark mode switching** for an enhanced user experience.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Tkinter** – GUI framework for the interface  
- **Hashlib** – Used for SHA-256 password hashing  
- **Pyperclip** – Allows users to copy the hashed password to the clipboard  
- **Regex (re module)** – Validates password complexity  

## 🎯 Features  
✔ **Real-time Password Strength Analysis** (Weak, Moderate, Strong)  
✔ **SHA-256 Hash Generator** for added security  
✔ **Copy Hash to Clipboard** for easy access  
✔ **Toggle Password Visibility** (Show/Hide Password)  
✔ **Dark Mode Support** for better UI customization

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Enter a password** in the input field.  
2. Click **Analyze** to check password strength based on length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.  
3. The tool assigns a **strength rating** (Weak, Medium, Strong).  
4. **SHA-256 hash** of the password is generated for added security.  
5. Users can **copy the hash to the clipboard** for further use.  
6. Option to **switch between light and dark modes**.  

## 🔄 Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramansinghtanwar/Future_CS_02.git
   cd Future_CS_02
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install tk pyperclip
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python Password.py
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations  
- **Does not store passwords**, ensuring user privacy.  
- Uses **SHA-256 hashing**, a secure one-way encryption method.  
- Provides **visual password strength indicators** to encourage strong password practices.
